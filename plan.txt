what if you ik-ed the body to each leg

how does ik work?
start at one end, get angle and distance of next point
if distance is out of constraint (ex: too close, too far), preserve angle but change distance
do this for every point
do this for every point in reverse order
repeat until in constraints or cap it

how to adapt to spider?
every ACTIVE leg, if out of constraint (too far, maybe too close), pulls body towards leg
preserves the angle, changes the distance
